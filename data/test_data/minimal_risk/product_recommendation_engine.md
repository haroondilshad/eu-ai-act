# ShopSmart: Product Recommendation Engine

## System Overview

ShopSmart is an AI-powered product recommendation engine designed for e-commerce platforms that suggests relevant products to shoppers based on their browsing history, past purchases, and similar user behaviors. This system aims to enhance the shopping experience by presenting customers with products that match their interests and needs.

## System Purpose

The primary purpose of ShopSmart is to improve customer satisfaction and increase sales conversion rates by providing personalized product recommendations. The system is designed as a supplementary tool for online shopping platforms that helps users discover products they might be interested in but does not make any autonomous decisions affecting user rights or access to services.

## Target Users

- Online shoppers on e-commerce platforms
- E-commerce site managers and marketers
- Product merchandisers

## Deployment Context

ShopSmart is deployed exclusively on opt-in e-commerce platforms where users explicitly accept terms of service regarding personalization features. The system operates solely within the shopping context and does not affect user access to essential services, financial approvals, educational opportunities, employment, or other significant life areas.

## AI Capabilities

The system performs the following basic functions:
- Analysis of product viewing and purchase patterns
- Identification of product complementarity (frequently bought together)
- Matching of user preferences to product characteristics
- Generation of "You might also like" suggestions in a dedicated section of the website
- Seasonal and trending product highlights based on aggregated user activity

## Data Handling

ShopSmart processes the following types of data:
- Anonymous browsing history (products viewed)
- Purchase history (when users are logged in)
- Product metadata (category, price range, features)
- Aggregate trends across user segments

All data is processed in a privacy-preserving manner, with no processing of special categories of personal data. Users can opt out of personalized recommendations at any time, and data retention follows standard e-commerce practices.

## Transparency Features

The system implements the following straightforward transparency measures:
- Clear labeling of all recommendations as "Recommended for you" or "Based on your browsing"
- Simple explanation of recommendation basis accessible via an information icon
- Obvious controls to dismiss or hide unwanted recommendations
- Easy-to-find privacy settings that allow disabling of personalized recommendations

## Risk Assessment

The system has been evaluated as minimal risk because:
- It does not make decisions affecting fundamental rights or access to services
- It does not use manipulation techniques or exploit vulnerabilities
- It has no impact on health, safety, or fundamental rights
- It does not interact with physical systems or critical infrastructure
- It does not process biometric, special category, or sensitive personal data
- It presents recommendations as optional suggestions only

## Technical Implementation

- Collaborative filtering algorithms for "customers who bought this also bought that"
- Basic content-based filtering for product similarity
- Simple A/B testing for recommendation effectiveness
- Straightforward logging for performance monitoring

## Human Oversight

Product merchandisers review system performance weekly through dashboard metrics including:
- Click-through rates on recommendations
- Conversion rates from recommendations
- User feedback (helpful/not helpful ratings)
- Category distribution of recommended products

Merchandisers can manually adjust recommendation rules for product categories or promotional events when needed.
